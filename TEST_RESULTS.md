## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Database Schema Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Room model had new properties (`Name`, `IsAvailable`) that weren't in database
**Solution**: Created and applied migration `AddRoomNameAndIsAvailable`
**Result**: All room-related endpoints now working correctly

### Issue 2: Missing Search View ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: SearchController had no corresponding Index.cshtml view
**Solution**: Created complete Search/Index.cshtml with search filters and pagination
**Result**: Search functionality now has proper UI (pending restart)

### Issue 3: Admin Authentication ⚠️ PENDING
**Problem**: Admin dashboard returns 404 (likely authentication required)
**Solution**: Need to implement proper admin login flow
**Status**: Requires further investigation
